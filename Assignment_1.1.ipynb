    "#1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? \n",
    "#eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "#  * , 'hello', -87.8,  -,  / , +, 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: *, -,  / , +: these are Expressions and 'hello', 6, -87.8: these are values. \n",
    "\n",

    "#2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: A string can be defined in python with quotation marks or double quotation marks.\n",
    "          # We can assign a string to a variable.\n",
    "    # Whereas a variable can be defined as a name which is used to refer memory location which stores values of any data type.\n",

    "#3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: 1. Number: It is a numberic value which can be used to perform mathematical caluculations may be an interger or float\n",
    "         #2. Boolen: It is defined with 2 values True or False (0 or 1) which can be used to find out whether the given statement is true or false.\n",
    "         #3. Set: Set. A Set in python is an unordered collection of the data type. \n",

    "#4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "#Answer: An expression is any combination of symbols like a variable, constants, and operators representing a value to be evaluted. \n",
    "        #It should have one or more operators and at least one operand like variable or constant.\n",

    "#5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer: The assignment statements doesn't have any operators included as there will be an constant assigned value to it.\n",
    "        # Where as the expression is combination of constants with operators which gives a value on caluculating in the end.\n",

    "\n",
    "#Answer: We can assign an alphabet or a word as a variable name which can store a numberic data. Variable names don't start with number in python\n",
    "        #But 100 is numeric value which is equal to itself and will not allow to store any other variable constants.\n",
